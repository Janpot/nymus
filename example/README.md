# Example

## Summary

This example will run three instances of the same next.js app on 3 different base paths. It will alias a different locale folder for each of the three instances. It will also provide localized messages as React components, compiled by `nymus`.

For now it's just the next.js starter app, localized. I'm working on a more elaborate example.

## Instructions

To build the exmaple:

```
yarn build
```

To run the exmaple

```
